    Responsive Web Design
  </h2>
  <p> Responsive web design allows a siteâ€™s layout to change as the screen size being used to view that site changes. A wide screen display can receive a site design with multiple columns of content while a small screen can have that same content presented in a single column with text and links that are appropriately sized to be read and used on that smaller display.

<h3>
  Why is RWD important?
</h3>
<p> First, RWD supports the multi-device user. Second, one site to rule them all. Having one website to manage and one place to manage that site from will make it easier to keep the site updated. Third, Future Scalability. One of the best things about a responsive website is that this approach gives you the best chance to support newer devices and screens in the future. Responsive sites are fluid, scaling up or down as needed to best fit the screens being used to access the site.
