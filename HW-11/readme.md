MART 341 Web Design 50

I had pretty fun this week. I always wanted to make a Website that the image scrolls down. And it was fun to make my own website using my photos. I tried to use my favorite color palette.

I am excited to build up my own website for next week which is our final. I already have some ideas of it so hopefully I can start earlier for this time.
