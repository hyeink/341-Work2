###Assignment 6

In this week, I have learned about organizing websites, identifying and grouping specific elements within websites, including and embedding multi-media content, and adding metadata to further define our webpages.

I feel much better using HTML and I had pretty fun to make my own websites.

I still have to look up the notes that I have written from previous courses, but I hope I can make my own website not looking at them.

I usually go through the lesson for whole week and build the website on Sunday and Monday, but I will try to do my work faster next time.

I finished making website on Monday, but it didn't work because of video problem. I fixed it and hope it works now!
