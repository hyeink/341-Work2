#Assignment 8

In this week I made my own another website about the CJ Company that I want to get in in the future. It was a little bit hard for me because I had to go over week 7 again cause I already forgot most of them. It was great learning about CSS and how to use them in my website.

I got a font, Lora from Google. I downloaded all different kinds of Lora and used them. I adjusted font-size, text-align, etc. Also, I put a background-color and textblock-color. Hope it turns out well. Also, I had fun to use hover.

I haven't tried running website yet, but I hope it turns out at the first time!
