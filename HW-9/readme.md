Assignment 9

I had pretty fun time to build my own website. I used the logo that I made for my portfolio class. I will build the website more using this logo.

I used a color palette similar to my logo. I used Ivory, pink, and black to keep it simple.

I also used a TitilliumWeb font for my website.
I hope it fits well on my website and the logo.
